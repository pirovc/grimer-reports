Proportion of counts of selected observation (y-axis) against DNA Concentration (if provided) or Total number of counts (x-axis) of each sample, both in log10 scale. If provided, controls samples are displayed in a different color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A indication of contamination is when counts are inversely proportional to DNA concentration. The red and black dotted lines are the expected models for contamination and non-contamination, respectively. A good indication for contamination is when the dots (excluding control samples) \"fit\" the red line model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The P-score statistic is not a P-value and it is not associated with any guarantees on the type 1 error rate [1]. Small scores indicate the contaminant model is a better fit, and high scores indicate that the non-contaminant model is a better fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More details can be found in the &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://benjjneb.github.io/decontam/vignettes/decontam_intro.html\"&gt;DECONTAM Introduction guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] Davis, N.
